## Welcome to my Tower Defense Game 🏰

It's a fun project that I've made using **Greenfoot** - a 2d game engine - with Java and Object-oriented programming. 👀\
A lot of the animations & drawings are also made by me, it's what made the game so fun to work on!

If you've installed Greenfoot, feel free to try it out :)
